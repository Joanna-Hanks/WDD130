        <h2>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
        <p>
            I chose my favorite recipes and selected images that best represented each recipe. This helped ensure the site plan felt personal, cohesive, and visually appealing while still meeting the project requirements.
        </p>
    
        <h2>How did you communicate with your developer? Were there any issues with communication?</h2>
        <p>
            I communicated with my developer through Canvas messaging. Communication was clear, and there were no issues during the project.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, my developer met my expectations and followed the site plan as intended.
        </p>
    
        <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
        <p>
            Next time, I will make sure the site plan is completed and shared on time so developers do not have to ask for it.
        </p>
    
        <h2>How did you manage your development team and communicate tasks for your junior developers?</h2>
        <p>
            I managed my development team by messaging them on Canvas and clearly communicating the tasks they needed to complete.
        </p>
    
        <h2>How did you communicate with your client? Were there any issues?</h2>
        <p>
            I communicated with my client using Canvas messaging. There were no issues with communication.
        </p>
    
        <h2>How did you handle publishing your client’s site and sharing it with the client?</h2>
        <p>
            The client published their own site and shared it with the development team once it was complete.
        </p>
    
        <h2>How was your experience managing your site with GitHub?</h2>
        <p>
            Once GitHub was explained, it was straightforward to manage my site and push changes.
        </p>
    
        <h2>How did you communicate with your team lead? Were there any issues?</h2>
        <p>
            I communicated with my team lead through Canvas messaging. Initially, the lead developer did not reach out to assign tasks, but after I messaged him, he clarified what needed to be done.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, I understood what was expected of me for each site.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, I created my assigned pages and successfully pushed them to GitHub.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h2>
        <p>
            The only issue I experienced was waiting for my lead developer to merge my pull requests into the main branch.
        </p>
    
        <h2>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h2>
        <p>
            The most challenging part was making sure I followed exactly what the client wanted without adding my own design ideas. I was able to overcome this and successfully complete my assigned pages.
        </p>
    
        <h2>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h2>
        <p>
            I most enjoyed working on the CSS and making the design look clean and visually appealing.
        </p>
    
        <h2>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h2>
        <p>
            If I could do the project again, I would communicate more with my teams so it would be easier to ask questions when needed.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Do you feel more confident working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, I feel more confident after completing this project. Being able to see how much I accomplished showed me that I am capable of working on real-world projects, even when I doubt myself.
