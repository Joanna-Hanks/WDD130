                <h2>Hi, I'm Joanna Hanks</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m someone who enjoys learning, building, and creating. Whether I’m working on 
                    a project for school or experimenting with new ideas, I approach everything with 
                    curiosity and a desire to grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in thoughtful design, purposeful work, and the idea that small, consistent
                    steps lead to meaningful progress.

                <p>
                    I value clarity, creativity, and meaningful work. I love creating things that have purpose 
                    and structure while still leaving room for personal expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work reflects calm design, intentional color choices, and layouts that feel organized 
                    and welcoming.
